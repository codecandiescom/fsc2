1. At least one of the Tektronix digitizers does not send back a correct
   value when asked for an area of a window if the window width has been
   set to one point. Checks are needed if this is a problem with all models,
   if this also happens when fetching a curve and how to solve the
   problem. Could it be that we always fetch one point less than people
   asked for? (Unlikely)
