/*!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
   STILL COMPLETELY UNTESTED: Handling of EXTERNAL trigger mode by creating one
   block with "DATA:SEQ:TWAIT" for this block and running in enhanced mode. I
   urgently need access to a real device for testing if this is the way to do
   it - the manual is no help at all at trying to figure out what to do...

   Is this still valid?  2000/7/9

/*
 *  <RANT>
 *  The guys that wrote the firmware of this digitizer as well as the
 *  documentation are not only a fucking bunch of morons but should be
 *  quartered, hanged and burned. Not only did they introduce some very
 *  annoying bugs but also made live a hell for the programmers that have no
 *  choice but to try to use their piece of crap.
 *
 *  Here a few of the bugs as far as I found them yet (text taken from an email
 *  I sent to Tektronix/Sony):
 *
 *  In run mode : Repeat
 *   When I create a data pattern starting with a high state (1) at the very
 *   first address in one of the channels and then start data pattern output
 *   by pressing the START/STOP button (or sending the START command via the
 *   GPIB interface) the DG2020 will output a pulse of 250 us length before
 *   starting to output the data pattern. It doesn't matter if there is a
 *   sequence defined or not, the 250 us pulse is always there and is easy
 *   visible with a digital oscilloscope when using resolutions and data
 *   pattern lengths in the nanosecond range.
 *
 *  In run mode : Single
 *   In the same situation as above, i.e. a data pattern starting with high at
 *   the very first address, pressing the START/STOP button leads to an
 *   obviously infinite pulse (at least more than a minute) and no data
 *   pattern output is to be seen. If there is no data pattern bit set to high
 *   at the first address there is no output at all. This renders the Single
 *   mode complete unusable.
 *
 *  I also had lots of problems using the GBIP commands as given in the
 *  manual. Some of the ones I tried to use don't work as described there.
 *  For example:
 *
 *     a.) DATA:BLOCK:DEFINE <Blockinfo>
 *         this command works if one defines just one block but if one tries to
 *         define several blocks at once as described in the manual the command
 *         fails. E.g. the command
 *                  DATA:BLOC:DEF #2110,B1<LF>328,B2
 *         (where <LF> is the the line feed character 0x0A) results in a
 *               2075,"Illegal block size"
 *         error message (as returned by "ALLEV?") - and, of course, no blocks
 *         are defined.
 *
 *         The only way around this error is to define the first block with
 *         DATA:BLOCK:DEFINE and use DATA:BLOCK:ADD to define the other
 *         blocks.  (There is also a rather strange irregularity in these
 *         commands: while in the DEFINE command one has to enter the block
 *         name without quotes in the ADD command one needs quotes around the
 *         block name...)

 *
 *     b.) DATA:PATTERN:BIT ...
 *         Normally this command results in a
 *               2022,"Pattern data byte count error"
 *         but works on some occasions - I was not able to figure out under
 *         what conditions (of course I checked and rechecked that the numbers
 *         given in the command were correct). Just by chance I found, that
 *         the command always seems to work if one preceeds it by a semicolon,
 *         i.e. as if it would be part of a concatenated command.
 *
 *  Ok, so far about some real stupid fuck-ups in the firmware as well as in
 *  the documentation. But these guys also obviously spend so much time
 *  writing a more or less completely useless user interface that they didn't
 *  had the time to implement reasonable GPIB commands. E.g., who can be that
 *  stupid to write a command for setting pattern bits in a way that you have
 *  to send a complete byte over the already slow enough GPIB bus just to set
 *  one single bit of a pulser channel? And why isn't there at least a command
 *  to set a block of pattern bits by sending the start end length plus the
 *  state? And, finally, why isn't there for more than 90% of the stuff that
 *  you can do via the keyboard an equivalent GPIB command?
 *

 *  Ok, they implemented the possibility to simulate all the things that you
 *  can do via the keyboard with the "ABSTouch" command but than made it
 *  complete useless by not giving the programmer a chance to find out in
 *  which mode the display is and where the cursors currently are etc...  That
 *  makes writing stuff using this feature like manually setting the digitizer
 *  without being able to watch the display. And even if this would be
 *  possible I really don't want to sent 25 commands down the GPIB bus just to
 *  simulate a complete rotation of a knobs (when you may need 20 rotations or
 *  more), or 35 commands just to move the cursor from channel 35 up to
 *  channel 0. Fucking idiots!
 *
 *  Why do they have to have a minimum block size of 64 bits? Without this
 *  limitation you could do a lot of things in a real nice way, but so all you
 *  can do is to write a lot of bloody hacks and really cool things are simply
 *  impossible to do.
 *
 *  Just another problem with the documentation: Why is there no
 *  comprehensible explanation of how to run the pulser in repeat mode but
 *  each repetition of the sequence starting on a trigger in event? Am I
 *  supposed to be clairvoyant or do these guys expect that I spend hours
 *  writing test programs until I find out what mode to use which what kinds
 *  of settings?
 *
 *  And when you sent them emails (via their local distributor) to ask about
 *  these problems they not only let you wait for eternities (in my case half
 *  a year) but don't answer the most important question at all (the problem
 *  with the 250 us/infinitely long pulses) and with lots of bullshit about
 *  the others. And all this in a nearly incomprehensible english. Before this
 *  I had the impression that Tektronix's devices are quite good and
 *  especially the programming interface was real good but since they have
 *  been bought up by Sony much seems to have gone down the drain. Obviously,
 *  people at Sony have a problem understanding the difference between a
 *  walkman and a pulse data generator...

 * Unfortunately, the Frankfurt pulser sometimes doesn't execute a command
 * to set or clear some bits in a channel. Since I don't have any idea why
 * but this can completely destroy a measurement the following is a hack
 * to avoid this kind of errors:
 * Each time bits are set this is stored by a call of dg2020_gpib_store().
 * Now, after each update of the pulser by a call of dg2020_update_data()
 * dg2020_gpib_check() is called. Here the patterns changed by previous
 * commands are read in from the pulser and compared with the state they
 * should be in (this can't be done immediately after the setting because
 * we get a valid reply only after the update command). If we detect a
 * difference the corresponding command is repeated and the result again
 * is checked. In order to avoid getting into an infinite loop of failed
 * commands this cycle is only repeated 'MAX_CHECK_RETRIES' times (see
 * definition below).
 * Unfortunately, this checking will increase the time to setup the pulser
 * quite a lot. To get rid of the checking just comment out the line
 *
 *     dg2020_gpib_store( channel, address, length, state );
 *
 * in the function dg2020_set_constant().
