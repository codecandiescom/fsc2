Critical points:

Switching output on: everything for the sourcing mode must be correct

If output is on:

   a) changing output mode (voltage <-> current
   b) switching off autorange

When switching output on and HIGHC is on several settingsget modified
automatically (without an error)

Errors are only are reported when output is on and and one of these
settings is set to something not possible - the error is even reported
when it doesn't influence the current sourcing mode, i.e. trying to
set too low a lowrangi even when in voltage sourcing mode.
