A) Requirements
===============

The following tools and libraries are needed to create fsc2:

 1) gmake
 2) gcc
 3) flex
 4) bison
 5) install
 6) mail
 7) sed
 8) addr2line
 9) XFORMS library (version 0.89 or higher)
10) GPIB library

To create the complete documentation also needed are

11) makeinfo
12) tex
13) convert
14) dvips
15) perl (version 5.0 or higher)
16) pdftex
17) gzip


The XFORMS library is available from e.g.

  ftp.cs.ruu.nl/pub/XFORMS
  einstein.phys.uwm.edu/pub/xforms
  ftp.fu-berlin.de/unix/X11/gui/xforms
  ftp.st.ryukoku.ac.jp/pub/X11/xforms
  ftp.via.ecp.fr/pub2/xforms
  ftp.unipi.it/pub/mirror/xforms
  ftp.uni-trier.de/pub/unix/X11/xforms


The GPIB library consists of a library and a module to interface GPIB cards.
You can either use the one written by me (works with 2.0, 2.2 and 2.4
kernels), the older LLP library to be found at

  ftp.llp.fu-berlin.de/pub/linux/LINUX-LAB/IEEE488

(probably won't work with 2.2. and 2.4 kernels) or the library by National
Instruments to be downloaded from

  http://www.natinst.com

(works with 2.2 kernels). Unfortunately, only the LLP library supports cards
from other companies than National Instruments.


B) Preparing for Installation
=============================

After installing the required tools and libraries and extracting the archive
go into the new directory called fsc2. Edit the Makefile in this subdirectory.

Normally, the program and all auxiliary files will be installed in /usr/local
(specifically /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/lib/fsc2, /usr/local/info and
/usr/local/share/doc). To change this edit the first lines of the Makefile.

If you use the National Instruments GPIB driver you can change the place
where fsc2 expects the configuration file. Usually this does need to be
changed. When running fsc2 writes a lot of information about the activity
on the GPIB bus into a log file. You may change the default, /tmp/gpib.log,
to something more appropriate, or even /dev/null.

If you are still using the old libc (version 1) please search for the line

  ifeq ($(machine_name),pion.anorg.chemie.uni-frankfurt.de)
	  CFLAGS    += -DIS_STILL_LIBC1
  endif

and relace 'pion.anorg.chemie.uni-frankfurt.de' replaced with fully qualified
hostname of your machine.


Now also edit the Makefile in the subdirectory 'src'. Here you should search
for the lines starting with the label '.PHONY:' and add a line with the
fully qualified hostname of your machine.

Now search for the comment

  # Machine specific stuff: different GPIB interfaces and resource files
  # for the graphical interface are needed...

below you will find an entry for each machine fsc2 is currently running on.
A typical entry for as machine is

  pion.anorg.chemie.uni-frankfurt.de:
	  $(MAKE) hi_res
	  $(MAKE) gpib_old

Please append a similar entry for your machine (please take care that the
second and third line has to start with a tabulator character, not simple
spaces). If your machine has a high resolution display, i.e. a 17" monitor
or better keep the line

	  $(MAKE) hi_res

otherwise change it to

	  $(MAKE) low_res

If you use the LLP GPIB library keep the line

	  $(MAKE) gpib_old

If you use the National Instruments library change it to

	  $(MAKE) gpib_ni

If you use my GPIB library use instead

	  $(MAKE) gpib_jtt


You may finally also want to edit the Makefile in the subdirectory 'utils'
to check if the location for the emacs EDL mode file suits your setup.


C) Compiling and Installing
===========================

Go back into the main directory of the package and type 'make'. This may
take some time to finish. A few warnings may show up during the compilation,
especially when the documentation is created and some of the required tools
are not available. It can even happen that make stops with an error message
in this case. This does *not* mean that the program didn't compile
succesfully!

Please don't start make from one of the subdirectories, this is bound to
fail.

If you get more than a few warnings during the compilation stage of the
program or the make process even fails you should send me an email with the
output of make.

When the compilation of the program succeded (even though the creation of
the documentation failed at some stage), you can now install the program
by typing 'make install'. Normally, you will need root privileges to do so.
You should skip the installation if you changed the installation directory
from '/usr/local' to './', i.e. the main directory of the package.


D) Simple Tests
===============

The subdirectory 'edl' contains several several EDL programs that you can use
to test fsc2 and get aquinted with the syntax. Please note that some of the
files will not work - I didn't had time to systematically weed them out.
There are a few programs that will even work without any devices, these are

  a.edl
  gr.edl
  stoch.edl
  z.edl
  zz.edl
  2d_endor_test.edl
  2_td.edl

Just start by typing 'fsc2 a.edl' or 'fsc2 z.edl' to get an idea about how
fsc2 displays 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional data sets.

                            Lots of fun,
                                          Jens Thoms Toerring
