The files in these directories are used to simpify the compilation
and installation of fsc2 on well known machines. Normally, one would
have to edit the makefile in the main directory of the package (and
possibly also in the 'modules' subdirectorty) and apply the necessary
changes to adapt it for the machine whenever one installs a new version.

To avoid this, in the make and install processes the makefiles
involved will look for files with names starting with the fully
qualified hostname of the machine in this directory and include
them if they exist.

For the basic configuration there's a template file, 'template.nowhere'.
You just have to copy it to a file with the fully qualified hostname
(use 'hostname -f' to find it out) and then edit this file.

Up to three files will get included. As an example in the following
it is assumed that the fully qualified hostname of the machine fsc2
is to be compiled and installed is 'hex.unseen.edu'. In the process
the files in the 'machines' directory will be searched for:

hex.unseen.edu
hex.unseen.edu-config
hex.unseen.edu-install

The first file 'hex.unseen.edu' must contain just definitions as
you will find them in a makefile. It is for setting the variables
from the start of the makefile in the main directory, overriding
any settings made in that makefile. Here's the list of variables
that may be set in this file:

OWNER
GROUP
DEF_INCL_DIR
GPIB_LIBRARY
GPIB_CONF_FILE
GPIB_LOG_FILE
GPIB_LOG_LEVEL
GPIB_HEADER_DIR
NUM_SERIAL_PORTS
SERIAL_LOCK_DIR
SERIAL_LOG_FILE
SERIAL_LOG_LEVEL
WITH_NI6601
ni6601_libs
WITH_ME6000
me6000_libs
WITH_WITIO_48
witio_48_libs
WITH_RS_SPEC10
rs_spec10_incl
rs_spec10_libs
WITH_HTTP_SERVER
DEFAULT_HTTP_PORT
NO_MAIL
USE_FSC2_MTA
USE_IPv6
MAIL_ADDRESS

What they mean is explained in some detail at the top of the
makefile in the main directory.

The file 'hex.unseen.edu-config' is a file with commands that
get executed before the compilation starts. It can e.g. be used
to automatically change configuration files for devices etc.
(or with whatever ideas you come up with).

The third file, 'hex.unseen.edu-install', again is a makefile that
gets included during installation of fsc2. It should contain two
(phony) targets,

install-hex.unseen.edu:

uninstall-hex.unseen.edu:

Here you can list commands that are required when the modules get
installed or un-installed. Usually, this are commands to create
additional symbolic links to allow accessing modules with simpler
aliases.
