@appendix Acknowledgments


A large part of @code{fsc2} has been written while I was working in the
groups of Prof.@: Th.@: Prisner (J.-W.-Goethe-Universit@"at,
Frankfurt/Main) and Prof.@: K.@: M@"obius (Freie Universit@"at
Berlin). Both where so kind to allow me to spend quite large amounts of
time on getting it to the state it is in now. Prof.@: R.@: Bittl (Freie
Universit@"at Berlin) and Prof.@: H.-J.@: Steinhoff (Universt@"at
Osnabr@"uck) supported the development by employing me to to extend the
program and write further device drivers.

Special thanks to Anton Savitsky for writing the module for the
@w{Thurlby 330} programable power supply and allowing me to include
it into the distribution.

All the people using the program so far have from time to time been
(mis)used as alpha-testers. The first one accepting this unpleasant role
has been Axel Weber in Frankfurt/Main, who already dealt with the bugs
and shortcomings of the very first version. Then, in Berlin, Stefan
Weber, Chris W.@: M.@: Kay, Gerriet Eilers, Andreas Kuppig, Heike
M@"ogling, Michael Fuhs, Anton Savitsky, Alexander Schnegg, Radek
Kowalczyk, Martin Fuchs, Celine Els@"asser, Marc Brecht and Hauke
Studier took over. Finally, also Iwo Gatlik, Tomasz Motylewski and
Daniela Hristova (University Basel) got some share of the fun. I would
like to thank them not only for the constant stream of bug reports and
proposals for improvements or new features (and I sometimes needed quite
a lot of convincing even though they where right) but especially for
their enduring patience. Much too often, when they had to do an
important experiment things didn't work and they had to wait until I got
it fixed. Lots of thanks to all of them!
