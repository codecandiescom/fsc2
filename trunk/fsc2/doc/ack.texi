@appendix Acknowledgments


A large part of @code{fsc2} has been written while I was working in the
groups of Prof.@: Th.@: Prisner (J.-W.-Goethe-University,
Frankfurt/Main) and Prof.@: K.@: M@"obius (Free University Berlin). Both
where so kind to allow me to spend quite large amounts of time on
getting it to the state it is in now.

All the people using the program so far have from time to time been
mis-used as alpha-testers. The first one accepting this unpleasant role
has been Axel Weber in Frankfurt/Main, who already dealt with the bugs
and shortcomings of the very first version. Then, in Berlin, Stefan
Weber, Chris W.@: M.@: Kay, Gerriet Eilers, Andreas Kuppig, Heike
M@"ogling, Michael Fuhs, Anton Savitsky, Alexander Schnegg, Radek
Kowalczyk, Martin Fuchs and Celine Els@"asser took over. Finally, also
Iwo Gatlik, Tomasz Motylewski and Daniela Hristova (University Basel)
got some share of the fun. I would like to thank them not only for the
constant stream of bug reports and proposals for improvements or new
features (and I sometimes needed quite a lot of convincing even though
they where right) but especially for their enduring patience. Much too
often, when they had to do an important experiment, things didn't work
and they had to wait until I got it fixed. Lots of thanks to all of them!
