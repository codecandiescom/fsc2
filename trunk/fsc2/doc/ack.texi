@appendix Acknowledgments


@acronym{fsc2} has been written mostly while I was working in the groups
of Prof.@: Th.@: Prisner (J.-W.-Goethe-University, Frankfurt/Main) and
Prof.@: K.@: M@"obius (Free University Berlin). Both where so kind to
allow me to spend quite large amounts of time on getting it to the state
it is in now.

All the people using the program sofar have from time to time been
mis-used as alpha-testers. The first one accepting this unpleasant
r@^ole has been Axel Weber in Frankfurt, who already dealt with the bugs
and shortcomings of the very first version (yes, there was a
@acronym{FSC}, then without a @code{1}).  Later in Berlin Stefan Weber,
Chris W.@: M.@: Kay, Gerriet Eilers, Andreas Kuppig, Heike M@"ogling,
Michael Fuhs, Anton Savitsky, Alexander Schnegg and Radek Kowalczyk took
over. Finally, also Iwo Gatlik and Tomasz Motylewski (Basel University)
had some share of the fun. I would like to thank them not only for the
constant stream of bug reports and proposals for improvements or new
features (and I sometimes needed quite a lot of convincing) but,
especially, for their enduring patience. Much too often when they wanted
to do an important experiment things didn't work and they had to wait
until I got it fixed. So, again, many thanks to all of you.
