This text describes @code{fsc2}, a program to control (mostly cw- and
pulsed EPR) spectrometer. Basically, @code{fsc2} is an interpreter to
run a program that describes how the experiment is to be done. After an
overview the syntax to be used is explained. This is followed by a
section about the built-in functions that may be used in the
program. Finally, it is explained who one can write modules for new
devices to be used in the experiment.
