.SH NAME
fsc2 \- program for remote control of EPR spectrometer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fsc2
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fIFILE\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.B Fsc2
is a program that allows to remotely control an EPR spectrometer. Its input
is a program written in a language called
.B EDL
that enables the user to describe exactly how the experiment is to be done,
which data are to be written to files and how the data are to be displayed.

.B WARNING:
A complete description of
.B fsc2
and the
.B EDL
language is much too long for a manual page. Please read the Texinfo
or PostScript, PDF or HTML documentation installed with the program (see
below for details).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-t\fR FILE
Runs a syntax check on the input file and quits. No graphic is
used and all output is written to the controlling terminal.
.TP
\fB\-T\fR FILE
Starts
.B fsc2
in graphics mode and immediately does a syntax check opf the input file.
When done with the check the program waits for further commands.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR FILE
Starts
.B fsc2
in graphics mode and immediately does a syntax check on the input file.
If the syntax check does not fail the experiment is started without needing
further user input.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR FILE
Starts
.B fsc2
in graphics mode and loads the input file. The input file will be
automatically deleted when
.B fsc2
is done with it, i.e. when either
.B fsc2
is exits or a new file is loaded. This flag is only useful for cases where
the input file is a temporary file that needs to be deleted automatically
when it isn't needed anymore.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Displays a very short help text and exits.
.SH SEE ALSO
The complete documentation for
.B fsc2
in PostScript, PDF and HTML format can be found in the directory
DOCDIR. Alternatively, the command
.IP
.B info fsc2
.PP
should give you access to the manual in Texinfo format.
