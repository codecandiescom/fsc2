.SH NAME
fsc2 \- program for remote control of EPR spectrometers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fsc2
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fIFILE\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Fsc2
is a program for the remote control of EPR spectro\%meters. It interprets
programs written in a language called \fBEDL\fR (\fBE\fRxperiment
\fBD\fRescription \fBL\fRanguage) that enables the user to describe exactly
how the experiment is to be done, which of the measured data are to be written
to files and how these data are to be displayed.

A complete description of \fBfsc2\fR and the \fBEDL\fR language is much too
long for a manual page. Please read the Texinfo, PostScript, PDF or HTML
documentation which should be installed with the program (cf. the \fBSEE
ALSO\fR section below for details).
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-t\fR FILE
Runs a syntax check on the input file and quits. No graphic is
used and all output is written to the controlling terminal.
.TP
\fB\-T\fR FILE
Starts \fBfsc2\fR in graphics mode and immediately does a syntax check of the
input file.  When done with the check \fBfsc2\fR waits for further commands.
.TP
\fB\-S\fR FILE
Starts \fBfsc2\fR in graphics mode and immediately does a syntax check on the
input file.  If the syntax check does not fail the experiment is started
without needing further user input.
.TP
\fB\-d\fR FILE
Starts \fBfsc2\fR in graphics mode and loads the input file (or also tests
and/or starts the program when used in conjunction with the \fB\-T\fR or
\fB\-S\fR flags). The input file will be \fBautomatically deleted\fR when
\fBfsc2\fR is done with it, i.e. when either \fBfsc2\fR exits or a new file is
loaded. This flag is only useful for cases where the input file is a temporary
file that needs to be deleted when it isn't needed anymore, so better be
real careful.
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Displays a very short help text and exits.
.SH SEE ALSO
The complete documentation for
.B fsc2
in PostScript, PDF and HTML (with and without using frames) format can be
found in the directory DOCDIR. Alternatively, the command
.IP
.B info fsc2
.PP
should give you access to the manual in the GNU info format.

Many thanks to the all people who helped to test the program, proposed lots of
new ideas and constantly send in bug reports: \fBAxel Weber\fR (J.-W.-Goethe
University Frankfurt/Main), \fBStefan Weber\fR, \fBChris W. M. Kay\fR,
\fBGerriet Eilers\fR, \fBAndreas Kuppig\fR and \fBHeike Moegling\fR (all at
the Free University of Berlin). Also thanks to \fBTh. Prisner\fR
(Goethe-University Frankfurt/Main) and \fBK. Moebius\fR (Free University of
Berlin) for allowing me to spend lots of 'company time' on writing the
program.
