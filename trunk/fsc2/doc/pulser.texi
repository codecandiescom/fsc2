@section Pulser Overview

Using the pulsers has its own chapter because several special methods
to handle the pulser setup, create pulses und how to do phase cycling
have to be introduced. Beside, the way the pulser is to be used depends
rather strongly on the other hardware used in the spectrometer.
Currently, there are three combinations of pulsers and spectrometers
implemented:
@itemize @bullet
@item Sony/Tektronix DG2020 with S-band spectrometer in Frankfurt/Main
@item Sony/Tektronix DG2020 with X-band spectrometer in Berlin
@item Tektronix HFS9003 with W-band spectrometer in Berlin
@end itemize
Because of the importance of the pulser for time-resolved experiments
there are even two additional types of sections in the @acronym{EDL} in
order to setup the pulser. These are
@example
ASSIGNMENTS
PHASES
@end example
While the first one deals with the basic setup of the pulser the second
one is only necessary when phase cycling is used. Valid statements in
these sections differ slightly, depending on the type of the pulser and
the spectrometer it is supposed to work with.

Beside these additional sections there are some other construct for the
creation of pulses and their subsequent manipulation. These are
identical for all pulsers.

@section Setting up the Pulser

The basic setup of the pulser happens in the @code{ASSIGNMENTS} and the
@code{PHASES} section. The latter section will be missing if no phase
cycling is planned for the experinment.

@anchor{ASSIGNMENTS}
@subsection @code{ASSIGNMENTS} section
@cindex ASSIGNMENTS section

@anchor{Setting the TIMEBASE}
@subsubsection Setting the @code{TIMEBASE}
@cindex Setting the @code{TIMEBASE}

The first statement of the @code{ASSIGNMENTS} section has be the setting
of the timebase of the pulser. All pulser supported be the pulser work
similarly: The have a certain number of time slices (actually, it are
65536) for which the output of the pulser can be either set to a high or
a low voltage. By setting the output during certain time slices to a
high voltage and for all the others to a low voltage pulses are created.
The timebase to be set first in the @code{ASSIGNMENT} section is the
length of one of these time slices. From the above it is clear, that all
pulses (as well as all the times between pulses) have to be integer
multiples of the length of the time slices.

The statement to set the timebase, i.e.@ the length of the individual
time slices is:
@example
TIMEBASE: 5 ns;
@end example
Alternatively, one may also write @code{TB:}, @code{T_B}, @code{TBASE:},
@code{T_BASE:}, @code{TIMEB}, @code{TIME_B:} or @code{TIME_BASE:} insetad
of @code{TIMEBASE:}. Please note that, whatever form you choose, it has
to end with a colon.

The minumum and maximum values for the timebase differ for both types of
pulsers:
@itemize @bullet
@item Sony/Tektronix DG2020: @w{5 ns} to @w{0.1 s}
@item Tektronix HFS9003: @w{1.6 ns} to @w{20 us}
@end itemize

@anchor{Setting the trigger mode}
@subsubsection Setting the trigger mode
@cindex Setting the trigger mode

The next statement new is for the triggering of the pulser. A pulser starts
a new sequence of pulses either on receiving an external or it is
triggered internally. Which type of triggering is to be used depends, of
course, on the experiment. To set either to internal or external trigger
us a statement like this:
@example
TRIGGER_MODE: INTERNAL;
@end example
or
@example
TRIGGER_MODE: EXTERNAL;
@end example
Instead of @code{TRIGGER_MODE} also @code{TM:}, @code{T_M:},
@code{TRIGM:}, @code{TRIG_M:}, @code{TRIGMODE:}, @code{TRIG_MODE:},
@code{T_MODE:}, @code{TMODE:}, @code{TRIGGER_M:}, @code{TRIGGERM:} or
@code{TRIGGERMODE:} can be used. And the keywords @code{INTERNAL} and
@code{EXTERNAL} can be shortend to @code{INTERN} or @code{INT} and
@code{EXTERN} or @code{EXT}.

When using the internal trigger it is useful to be able to set the rate
or the frequency the experiment is repeated. For this type of triggering
an additional keyword can be specified, either @code{REPEAT_TIME} or
@code{REPEAT_FREQUENCY}, i.e.@ one may use
@example
TRIGGER_MODE: INTERNAL, REPEAT_TIME = 10 ms;
@end example
or
@example
TRIGGER_MODE: INTERNAL, REPEAT_FREQUENCY = 100 Hz;
@end example
to set the repetition rate of the the experiment to @w{100 Hz}. Please
note that the repeat time must be an intege multiple of the timebase of
the pulser.

@code{REPEAT_TIME} and @code{REPEAT_FREQUENCY} may also be abbreviated
to @code{REPT}, @code{REP_T}, @code{REPTIME}, @code{REPEAT_TIME},
@code{REPEAT_T}, @code{REPEATT} or @code{REPEATTIME} and @code{REPF},
@code{REP_F}, @code{REPFREQ}, @code{REP_FREQ}, @code{REPFREQUENCY},
@code{REP_FREQUENCY}, @code{REPEATF}, @code{REPEAT_F},
@code{REPEATFREQ}, @code{REPEAT_FREQ} or @code{REPEATFREQUENCY}.

On the other hand, when using an external trigger one may want to set the
trigger level, slope and, possibly, the tripper input impedance. This
done using a statement similar to one of these:
@example
TRIG_MODE: EXTERNAL, LEVEL = 3.5 V, SLOPE = NEGATIVE, IMPEDANCE = LOW;
@end example
or
@example
TM: EXTERNAL, LEVEL = -1.2 V, SLOPE = POSITIVE, IMPEDANCE = HIGH;
@end example
The keywords @code{LEVEL} can be shortend to @code{LEV}, @code{SLOPE} to
@code{SL}, @code{POSITIVE} to @code{POS}, @code{NEGATIVE} to @code{NEG},
@code{IMPEDANCE} to @code{IMP} and, finally, @code{HIGH} to @code{H} and
@code{LOW} to @code{L}.

@anchor{Channel setup}
@subsubsection Channel setup
@cindex Channel setup

The following statements described in the following deal with setting up
the channels of the pulser. The idea is to abstract from the output
connectors of the pulser and to use symbolic names for the
channels. This means that instead of specifying to output a pulse from
the connector @w{numbered 1} of the pulser later on, in the
@code{ASSIGNMENTS} section symbolic names for the functions of the
channels are defined and these symbolic names will be used when talking
about pulses. While this may be only a convenience in simple experiments
it makes it much simpler when doing e.g.@ phase cycling, because here
the same pulse must be output on different channels, depending on the
current phase. And instead of always specifying which output to use in a
certain situation, the program is told about which channels to use and
then is is left to the program to do the bookkeeping which output
channel is to be used for the current phase.

Currently, the following symbolic names for pulse functions are
defined:
@itemize @bullet
@item @code{MICROWAVE} (or @code{MW}, @code{MICRO_WAVE}, @code{MICROW},
      @code{MICRO_W}, @code{MWAVE}, @code{M_WAVE} or @code{M_W})
@item @code{TRAVELING_WAVE_TUBE} (or @code{TWT} )
@item @code{TRAVELING_WAVE_TUBE_GATE}
