Whenever you start @acronym{fsc2} you will see the following window:

@image{/home/jens/fsc2/doc/fsc2fig1,11cm}

The large white area in the upper halve is the browser that contains the
text of the current @acronym{EDL} program (after you loaded it). Below
the main browser is another browser which displays error messages as
well as the output from the @acronym{EDL} program.

On the left side you have a set of buttons:
@itemize @bullet
@item The @code{Load} button - when you click onto it a file selector
is shown that allows you to select a new @acronym{EDL} program
@item The @code{Reload} button - when you have edited the currently
loaded @acronym{EDL} program you have to click onto this button to
make @acronym{fsc2} load the changed file
@item The @code{Edit} button - when you click onto it an editor will
open up with the curently loaded @acronym{EDL} program. Which
editor to use depends on the environment variable @code{EDITOR},
when it isn't set @code{vi} is used as the default editor.
@item The @code{Test} button lets you check an @acronym{EDL} program 
after it has been loaded.
@item Using the @code{Start} button you start execution of the
@acronym{EDL} program, i.e.@ you start the measurement.
@item The @code{Quit} button is for leaving @acronym{fsc2}.
@item Pressing the @code{Help} button will start Netscape with the
documentation for @acronym{fsc2}.
@item Finally, the @code{Bug report} button will open an editor window
where you can compose a bug report. When you're finished the program
will allow you to mail me the bug report.
