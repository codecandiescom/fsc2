Whenever you start @acronym{fsc2} you will see the following window:

@image{fsc2fig1,11cm}

The large white area in the upper halve is the browser that contains the
text of the current @acronym{EDL} program (after you loaded it). Below
the main browser is another browser which displays error messages as
well as the output from the @acronym{EDL} program. On the right side of
the browsers is a slider that lets you move the border between both
browsers.

On the left side you have a set of buttons:
@itemize @bullet
@item The @code{Load} button - when you click onto it a file selector
is shown that allows you to select a new @acronym{EDL} program.
@item The @code{Reload} button - when you have edited the currently
loaded @acronym{EDL} program you have to click onto this button to
make @acronym{fsc2} load the changed file.
@item The @code{Edit} button - when you click onto it an editor will
open up with the curently loaded @acronym{EDL} program. Which
editor to use depends on the environment variable @code{EDITOR},
when it isn't set @code{vi} is used as the default editor.
@item The @code{Test} button lets you check an @acronym{EDL} program 
after it has been loaded.
@item Using the @code{Start} button you start execution of the
@acronym{EDL} program, i.e.@ you start the measurement.
@item The @code{Quit} button is for leaving @acronym{fsc2}.
@item Pressing the @code{Help} button will start Netscape with the
documentation for @acronym{fsc2}.
@item Finally, the @code{Bug report} button will open an editor window
where you can compose a bug report. When you're finished the program
will let you mail me the bug report.

The first window you see when you start @acronym{fsc2} contains the
following elements:
@itemize @bullet
@item At the top the browser for displaying the @acronym{EDL} file to be run
@item Below this another browser where error messages as well as output
from the @acronym{EDL} program will be displayed.
@item On the right side of the browsers is a slider that lets you move
the border between both browsers.

In each button one of the characters of the label is underlined. By
pressing the key for this letter each button can be triggered via the
keyboard - but note that, if the underlined letter is an uppercase
character, you have to enter the uppercase character from the keyboard!

While the test of the the @acronym{EDL} program is runnin most of the
buttons can not be used anymore (as indicated by their labels becoming
grayed out). The label of the @code{Test} button will become @code{Stop
Test} - so if you want to stop the test press the @code{Test} button
again.

During the test @acronym{fsc2} may detect problems with @acronym{EDL}
program or even errors. It then will print messages in the lower
browser. There are three categories of messages: Warnings, messages for
severe problems and fatal error messages. Warnings are printed in green,
messages for severe problems in blue and messages for fatal errors in
red (in the latter case the test is also aborted immediately).
