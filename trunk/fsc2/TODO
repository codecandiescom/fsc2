1. At least one of the Tektronix digitizers does not send back a correct
   value when asked for an area of a window if the window width has been
   set to one point. Checks are needed if this is a problem with all models,
   if this also happens when fetching a curve and how to solve the
   problem. Could it be that we always fetch one point less than people
   asked for? (Unlikely)

2. When increasing the magnification of the display of the measured data
   further and further there is a point after which rubish will get
   displayed (but the program does not crash). Since it will probably
   take a lot of work to get this resolved and, on the other hand, it
   only shows up under unreasonable situations (i.e. when doing stress
   tests) solving the problem has a rather low position on my priority
   list...
