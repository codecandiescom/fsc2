1. When increasing the magnification of the display of the measured data
   further and further there is a point after which rubish will get
   displayed (but the program does not crash). Since it will probably
   take a lot of work to get this resolved and, on the other hand, it
   only shows up under unreasonable situations (i.e. when doing stress
   tests) solving the problem has a rather low position on my priority
   list...

2. It's not completely clear if calling pulser_reset() and friends also
   do a pulser_update() automatically for all pulser modules. Question
   is if this should be done, but more importantly, all modules should
   have the same behaviour (which then should be documented).
