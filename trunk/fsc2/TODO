1. Introduce something like a not-opened file for discarding data. This
   would be useful for cases where in a program it is assumed that a
   file has ben opened for saving data but the user decided not to
   open the file.

2. When increasing the magnification of the display of the measured data
   further and further there is a point after which rubish will get
   displayed (but the program does not crash). Since it will probably
   take a lot of work to get this resolved and, on the other hand, it
   only shows up under unreasonable situations (i.e. when doing stress
   tests) solving the problem has a rather low position on my priority
   list...
