1. Check if the starting an experiment, then starting the web server (or
   e.g. printing to gv) and *not* closing the exec()ed program results
   in a failure to initialize the GPIB bus when trying to start a new
   experiment in combination with using either the LLP or the National
   Instrument GPIB driver and library. If this happens we need a patch
   for setting the close-on-exec flag for the device file of the GPIB
   board! Only tested to work correcty for my own GPIB driver/library
   (thanks to Martin Fuchs for pointing out the problem).

2. The Internet Explorer seems to have problems getting served corectly 
   by the web server, as far as I heard sometimes the graphics don't get
   delivered (again, Martin Fuchs found this problem).

3. When increasing the magnification of the display of the measured data
   further and further there is a point after which rubish will get
   displayed (but the program does not crash). Since it will probably
   take a lot of work to get this resolved and, on the other hand, it
   only shows up under unreasonable situations (i.e. when doing stress
   testing) solving the problem has a rather low position on my priority
   list...
