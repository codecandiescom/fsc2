1. Check if there's a way to find out from the Sony/Tektronix pulsers
   if a DATA:UPD command is finished, and if wait for this to happen.
   Currently the next read command may time out if the update takes
   more than the time out set in gpib.conf.

2. When increasing the magnification of the display of the measured data
   further and further there is a point after which rubish will get
   displayed (but the program does not crash). Since it will probably
   take a lot of work to get this resolved and, on the other hand, it
   only shows up under unreasonable situations (i.e. when doing stress
   tests) solving the problem has a rather low position on my priority
   list...
