1. The Internet Explorer seems to have problems getting served corectly 
   by the web server, I heard that sometimes the graphics don't get
   delivered (thanks to Martin Fuchs for pointing out the problem).

2. When increasing the magnification of the display of the measured data
   further and further there is a point after which rubish will get
   displayed (but the program does not crash). Since it will probably
   take a lot of work to get this resolved and, on the other hand, it
   only shows up under unreasonable situations (i.e. when doing stress
   tests) solving the problem has a rather low position on my priority
   list...
