1. When increasing the magnification of the display of the measured data
   further and further there is a point after which rubish will get
   displayed (but the program does not crash). Since it will probably
   take a lot of work to get this resolved and, on the other hand, it
   only shows up under unreasonable situations (i.e. when doing stress
   tests) solving the problem has a rather low position on my priority
   list...
