Please note:  This is a device driver in the making and it is not
              finished yet. Actually, the device driver for PCI E
              series boards itself seems to work more or less, but
              there's nothing yet for the AT MIO cards, there's no
              documentation and the accompanying library also isn't
              finished yet.
