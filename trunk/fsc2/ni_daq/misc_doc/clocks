The NI DAQs have two internal clocks, a "fast" and a "slow" clock. These
clocks can be used to control the timings when doing analog input, analog
output, counting or pulse creation. Furthermore, a clock frequency can be
output at the FREQ_OUT pin. Unfortunately, the way the clocks can be set
and the resulting timings for the different purposes can be a bit
confusing.

The highest frequency that can be achieved with the fast clock is 20 MHz,
while for the slow clock we can get up to 200 kHz. 

Per default only the fast clock is switched on. To also enable the slow
clock the 'Slow_Internal_Timebase' must be set.

The speed of the "slow" clock can be globally reduced by a factor of
2 by setting the 'Slow_Internal_Timebase' bit in the 'Clock_and_FOUT'
register.

Let's start with the output at the FREQ_OUT pin. Its frequency is
controlled by a set of flags in the 'Clock_and_FOUT' register.

1) Which clock is output depends on the 'FOUT_Timebase_Select' bit, if it
   is 0 the fast clock appears on the output, otherwise the slow clock.

2) Both output frequencies are slowed down by a factor of 2 by setting the
   'Slow_Internal_Time_Divide_By_2' bit (please note that the setting
   also influences the slow clock speed as seen by the other subsystems).

3) Additionally (and independently of the 'Slow_Internal_Time_Divide_By_2'
   bit) the clocks frequencies can be devided by an integer between 1 and
   16 (to devide by 16 set the lowest four bits in the 'Clock_and_FOUT'
   register to 0, otherwise to a value between 1 and 15).

Using these settings a frequency between a maximum of 20 MHz and a minimum
of 6.25 z can be output at the FREQ_OUT pin.

For the AI, AO and GPCT subsystem of the boards only frequencies of 20 MHz
and 10 MHz can be realized with the fast clock and 200 kHz and 100 kHz using
the slow clock. Which timebase is used depends on the diverse source settings
for the subsystem. For the AI subsystem a source setting of 'AI_IN_TIMEBASE1'
and 'IN_TIMEBASE2' can be used, for the AO system 'AO_IN_TIMEBASE1' and
'IN_TIMEBASE2' and for the GPCT system 'G_IN_TIMEBASE1' and 'IN_TIMEBASE2'.

As the names already indicate, the fast timebases (x_IN_TIMEBASE1) of the
subsystems are independent of each other. Each can be switched between
20 MHz and 10 MHz individually by setting the 'AI_Source_Divide_By_2',
'AO_Source_Divide_By_2' and 'G_Source_Divide_By_2' bit, respectively.

In contrast, for all subsystems the 'IN_TIMEBASE2' is always identical
and it can be switched between 200 kHz and 100 kHz only for all subsystems
at once, using the 'Slow_Internal_Timebase' bit, which also controls the
output frequency at the FREQ_OUT pin.
