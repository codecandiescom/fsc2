  This file contains configuration information for controlling the Bruker
  ER035M gaussmeter when accessed via the GPIB bus and used in stand alone
  mode, i.e. not used for field control but just to measure fields. This
  file will be included as a header file, so the syntax must be valid C
  and changes will only become visible after re-compilation of the module.

/* Define the name that's going to be used for the device. It must be
   identical to the name used in the GPIB configuration file (usually
   /etc/gpib.conf). */
