  This file contains configuration information for controlling the
  Keithley 288A power supply that is used for sweeping the Berlin
  W-band magnet. This file will be included as a header file, so
  the syntax must be valid C and changes will only become visible
  after re-compilation of the module.

/* Define the name that's going to be used for the device. It must be
   identical to the name used in the GPIB configuration file (usually
   /etc/gpib.conf). */

#define DEVICE_NAME "KEITHLEY228A"


/* Define the voltage reduction ratio due to the potential divider at
   the power supplies modulation input (which reduces the voltage from
   the lock-in to a useful value) */

#define V_TO_A_FACTOR   -96.35


/* By defining the next two constants you can set which lock-in amplifier
   and which DAC port is going to be used to produce the modulation voltage
   for the power supply. LOCKIN_NAME must be a string, currently either
   "SR510", "SR530", "SR810" and "SR830" are supported. LOCKIN_DAC must be
   an integer identical to the number of the DAC that's going to be used (see
   the backside of the lockin). For the SR510 and the SR530 this can ber
   either 5 or 6, for both the other a number between 1 and 4.
   None of these values must be defined, if undefined the first lock-in
   found in the devices section will be picked with a default DAC port number
   (6 for SR510 and SR530, 4 for SR810 and SR830). It's probably not a good
   idea to define the DAC number only and not a lock-in name because then an
   invalid combination might be picked automatically. You may change the port
   that's going to be used at a later time by call of the function
   'magnet_use_dac_port()' anyway. */
