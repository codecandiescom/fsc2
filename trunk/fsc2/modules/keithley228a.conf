  This file contains configuration information for controlling the
  Keithley 288A power supply that is used for sweeping the Berlin
  W-band magnet. This file will be included as a header file, so
  the syntax must be valid C and changes will only become visible
  after re-compilation of the module.

/* Define the name that's going to be used for the device. It must be
   identical to the name used in the GPIB configuration file (usually
   /etc/gpib.conf). */

#define DEVICE_NAME "KEITHLEY228A"


/* Define the voltage reduction ratio due to the voltage divider at the
   power supplies modulation input (which reduces the voltage from the
   lock-in to a useful value). The minus sign is there because I didn't
   care enough when soldering together the voltage divider... */

#define V_TO_A_FACTOR   -96.35


/* By defining the next two constants you can set which lock-in amplifier
   and which DAC port is going to be used to produce the modulation voltage
   for the power supply. LOCKIN_NAME must be a string, currently either
   "SR510", "SR530", "SR810" and "SR830" are supported. LOCKIN_DAC must be
   an integer identical to the number of the DAC that's going to be used (see
   the backside of the lock-in amplifier). For the SR510 and the SR530 this
   can be either 5 or 6, for the SR580 and the SR580 a number between 1 and 4.
   Neither of these values must be defined. If LOCKIN_NAME is undefined the
   first lock-in found in the DEVICES section will be picked with a default
   DAC port number (6 for SR510 and SR530, 4 for SR810 and SR830). It's
   probably not a good idea to define the DAC number only and not a lock-in
   name because then an invalid combination might be picked automatically.
   But You may change the port that's going to be used at a later time by a
   call of the function 'magnet_use_dac_port()'. */

#define LOCKIN_NAME  "SR510"
