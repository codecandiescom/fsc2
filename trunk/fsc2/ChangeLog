1) Support for serial port has changed: in all former versions
   the 'number' of the serial port to be used had to be specified
   in calls for functions dealing with a serial port (i.e. '0'
   stood for the device file '/dev/ttyS0' etc.). This has been
   wasn't too good an idea when you also have to deal with e.g.
   USB-serial converters that appear under a device file with a
   name like '/dev/ttyUSB0' or '/dev/ttyUSB1' etc. So now in the
   call of fsc2_request_serial_port() the name of the device file
   has to be passed as the first argument instead of a number.
   The function now returns an integer that in all following calls
   is used as the 'handle' for the serial port for the serial port.

2) Changed libusb support to allow both libusb-0.1 and libusb-1.0.
   Which one of the two versions is linked in is controlled by the
   'WITH_LIBUSB_0_1' and 'WITH_LIBUSB_1_0' variable, to be set in
   the configuration settings for the machine fsc2 is to be compiled
   for (these variables replace the former 'WITH_LIBUSB' variable
   from previous versions of fsc2). Note: only use one of the
   versions of the library an be used, setting both variables
   will abort compilation!
