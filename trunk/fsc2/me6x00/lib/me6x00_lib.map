#  This library should simplify accessing ME6000 and ME6100 DAC boards
#  by Meilhaus Electronic GmbH by avoiding to be forced to make ioctl()
#  calls and use some higher level functions instead. Most functions are
#  based on the specifications for similar functions for the Windows API
#  supplied by Meilhaus Electronic GmbH, but there are several differences
#  that make the functions more UNIX-like and, unfortunately, require some
#  changes to your code should you try to port an application from a Windows.
