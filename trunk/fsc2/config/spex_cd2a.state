# In this file state information for the spex_cd2a driver is stored:
# 1. An offset of the monochromator, i.e. a number that always has to be
#    added to wavenumbers -or lengths reported by the monochromator and
#    subtracted from wavenumbers or -lengths send to the device.
# 2. The wavelength or wavenumber difference between two pixels of the
#    connected CCD camera\n"
# 3. For wavenumber driven monochromators only: the current setting of
#    the position of the laser line (as set at the SPEX CD2A).
