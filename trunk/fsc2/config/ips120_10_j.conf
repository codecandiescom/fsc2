  This file contains configuration information for controlling the
  Oxford IPS 120-10 magnet power supply when connected to the J band
  superconducting magnet of Edgar Groenen's group in Leiden. Adapt
  the data in here to fit a different magnet and rename it to

    ips120_10.conf

  This file will be included as a header file, so the syntax must be
  valid C and changes will only become visible after re-compilation
  of the module.
