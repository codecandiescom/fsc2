  This file contains configuration information for the chopper used in
  the group of G. Gescheidt (University Graz). It works by setting the
  FREQ_OUT pin of the PCI-MIO-16E-1 card (which is required for this
  module to work) to 10 MHz and adjusting the rotation speed of the
  chopper by outputting values at the DIO of the card.
  This file will be included as a header file, so the syntax must be
  valid C and changes will only become visible after re-compilation
  of the module.

/* The following value determines the maximum rotation speed of the chopper,

   a value could result in too high a rotation frequency which may damage
   the choppers motor. */
