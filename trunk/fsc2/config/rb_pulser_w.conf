  This file contains configuration information for controlling the
  W-band version of the RULBUS pulser, made up from 22 delay (RB8514)
  and 2 clock (RB8515) cards and using the pulse modulation unit SML-B3
  of the Rhode&Schwarz SML01 RF Synthesizer to create a single RF pulse.
  This file will be included as a header file, so the syntax must be
  valid C and changes will only become visible after re-compilation
  of the module.
