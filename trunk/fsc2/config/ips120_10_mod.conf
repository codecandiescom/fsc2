  This file contains configuration information for controlling the
  Oxford IPS 120-10 magnet power supply (via GPIB, using the GPV24
  RS232C to IEEE488 converter) with an additional external voltage
  input for finer control of current output. This file will be
  included as a header file, so the syntax must be valid C and
  changes will only become visible after re-compilation of the module.

/* Define the name that's going to be used for the device. It must be
   identical to the name used in the GPIB configuration file (usually
   /etc/gpib.conf). The device (i.e. the GPV24 converter) actually
   has _tow_ addresses, one for data and one for the control channel,
   but since the control channel isn't used only the connection via
   the GPIB address associated with DEVICE_NAME is going to be used
   (but take care not to use the other GPIB address for anz other
   device!).*/
