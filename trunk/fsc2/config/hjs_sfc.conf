  This file contains configuration information for controlling magnets
  in the group of H.-J. Steinhoff (University Osnabrueck). It works by
  just setting a voltage proportional to the required field and requires
  the DA/AD converter (module hjs_daadc) available in the group.
  This file will be included as a header file, so the syntax must be
  valid C and changes will only become visible after re-compilation
  of the module.
