  This file contains configuration information for controlling the
  DG2020 pulser when used with the Frankfurt pulsed S-band spectrometer
  configuration. This file will be included as a header file, so the
  syntax must be valid C and changes will only become visible after
  re-compilation of the module.

   identical to the name used in the GPIB configuration file (usually
   /etc/gpib.conf). */

   the pulse starts for which the phase gets set by the phase pulse. */

/* Defines the amount of time (in seconds) that we try to keep a phase pulse
   set after the end of the pulse for which the phase pulse was used. This
   allows for jitter and other effects (e.g. different cable lengths) which
   may lead to strange artefacts when the phase pulse would end to early. If
   the pulser time base is larger than the grace period set here the time
   base is used instead. Define GRACE_PERIOD as 0 to switch off use of the
   grace period. */
