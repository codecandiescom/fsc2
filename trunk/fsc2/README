fsc2 is a program for controlling spectrometers.

Programs for controlling spectrometers are usually home-written and
are often restricted to doing a certain set of experiments with a
fixed hardware base. In contrast, fsc2 is much more flexible because,
on the one hand, it interprets a rather simple but powerful scripting
language EDL (Experiment Description Language) and, on the other hand,
has a strictly modular approach to the handling of devices. This allows
setting up a completely new experiment (or changing an already existing
experiment description) fast and easily without requiring any detailed
knowledge of the internals of fsc2 or on how exactly the devices have
to be controlled.

* The EDL language is similar to other medium to high level languages,
  borrowing from e.g. MathLab, Fortran, C and Perl etc. Moreover, it
  comes with a lot of functions for displaying and saving measured
  data in completely user defined ways. Thus writing a description
  for a new experiment (or adapting an already existing EDL script)
  won't be difficult for anyone remotely acquainted with one of the
  above mentioned programming languages.

* Device are not hard-coded into fsc2. Instead, devices are dealt with
  by modules that get loaded on demand (a single instruction in an EDL
  script). This allows to employ a different device with similar
  functionality by usually changing not more than a single line in an
  EDL script.

* fsc2 allows other programs to send it EDL scripts for execution.
  Thus one may write scripts for standard experiments that in turn
  automatically create EDL scripts from user input, for example via
  a graphical user interface. fsc2 even comes with a tool that will
  automatically generate such scripts from (slightly modified) EDL
  programs. Once such a script has been created, "normal" users don't
  have to know how to write or change EDL programs, thus retaining all
  the convenience of the traditional type of programs but without
  sacrificing flexibility.

* fsc2 has a built-in simple web server (only running on user demand)
  that allows the experimentator to remotely monitor the state of an
  experiment.

* Currently fsc2 controls devices that are either connected via the
  serial ports or the GPIB bus. Functions for simplifying access of
  devices using these interfaces are built into fsc2.

* Writing new device modules (or adapting existing ones for a new device)
  shouldn't be too difficult for anyone having some experience with
  writing programs in C. About 30 modules for quite a range of devices
  are already part of the package and can be used as a starting point
  for the development of new ones.

* fsc2 is well-documented, an 150+ page documentation (in HTML, info,
  PostScript and PDF format), covering all aspects of fsc2, i.e the
  graphical interface, the EDL language, device functions and writing of
  new device modules, is part of the package.

* fsc2 has been extensively tested and is currently used to control seven
  EPR spectrometers, using a broad range of different devices and   
  experimental techniques.

* The complete sources for the program and all device modules are available
  under the GPL, so it can be adapted or extended to fit special needs.

Devices for which functional drivers already exist are:

* Tektronix Digitizing Oszilloscopes TDS 520, 520A, 520C, 540, 744A, 754A
* LeCroy Digitizing Oscilloscope 9400

* Stanford Research Lock-In Amplifier SR510, SR530, SR810, SR830
* AEG Magnet Power Supply (home-build computer control, S-, X-Band)
* Bruker Field controller ER 032 M
* Keithley 228A (used as superconducting magnet power supply)
* Oxford Magnet Sweep Power Supply IPS20-4
* Bruker Hall Effect Field Controller BH 15
* Bruker NMR Gaussmeter ER 035 M (F0, F1 probe, serial port and GPIB versions)
* Metrolab NMR Teslameter PT2025
* HP RF Synthesizer HP8647A
* Bruker Signal Channel ER 023 M
* Lake Shore 330 Temperature Controller
* Kontron 4060 Voltmeter

fsc2 works with three different GPIB driver/library combinations, the
Linux Lab Project driver (http://www.llp.fu-berlin.de), the National
Instruments driver (http://www.natinst.com) and a driver for NI PCII
and AT-GPIB/TNT (ISA) cards I wrote an which can be downloaded from
the same URL as fsc2, see below.

Of course, there are some limitations: due to my professional background
fsc2 has been written with the different types of EPR (Electron Paramagnetic
Resonance) experiments in mind. On the other hand, fsc2's basic concepts
should make it easy to use it also for a wide range of other types of
spectrometers.
