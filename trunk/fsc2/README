About fsc2
----------

fsc2 is a program, running under Linux, for controlling spectrometers.
Programs for spectrometer control usually are home-written and often
restricted to doing a certain set of experiments with only a fixed set
of devices. In contrast, fsc2 is much more flexible because it was
written with three main aims:

 * It should be easy for the user to set up new experiments without
   having to change the main program, i.e. without a programmer getting
   involved.

 * Devices should be exchangeable and support for new devices not
   necessitate changes of the basic program.

 * Users doing just standard experiments should only need to interact
   with a simple grapical user interface.

This flexibility has beed achieved by making fsc2 basically an interpreter
for a rather simple but powerful scripting language (EDL, Experiment
Description Language) and employing a strictly modular approach to the
handling of devices. This allows setting up a completely new experiment
or changing an already existing one fast and easily without requiring
any detailed knowledge of the internals of fsc2 or how exactly devices
are to be controlled by the computer - everything needed is to become
aquainted with the EDL scripting language. Moreover, an already working
script for an experiment can be swiftly made to display a graphical user
interface for just entering the currently required experimental parameters
by adding a few extra lines and then running it through a Perl script.

Features
--------

* The EDL language used to describe experiments is similar to other
  medium to high level languages, borrowing from e.g. MathLab, Fortran,
  C and Perl etc. Moreover, it comes with a lot of functions for data
  handling, displaying and saving in completely user defined ways. Thus
  writing a description for a new experiment or adapting an already
  existing EDL script won't be difficult for anyone remotely acquainted
  with one of the above mentioned programming languages.

* Device are not hard-coded into fsc2. Instead, devices are dealt with
  by modules that get loaded on demand (a single instruction in an EDL
  script). For each kind of devices a set of EDL functions exists to set
  up the device and fetch measured data. This allows e.g. to employ a
  different device with similar functionality by usually changing not
  more than a single line in an EDL script.

* fsc2 allows other programs to send it EDL scripts for execution.
  Thus one may write scripts for standard experiments that in turn
  automatically create EDL scripts from user input, for example via
  a graphical user interface. fsc2 even comes with a tool that auto-
  matically generates such scripts from slightly modified EDL programs.
  Once such a script has been created, "normal" users don't have to
  know how to write or change EDL programs, thus retaining all the
  convenience of the traditional type of programs but without
  sacrificing its flexibility.

* fsc2 has a built-in simple web server (only running on user demand)
  that allows the user to remotely monitor the state of an experiment.

* Currently fsc2 can control devices that are either connected via the
  serial ports or the GPIB bus or are realized as PCI cards (Linux
  drivers for these devices are supplied with the package).

* Writing new device modules (or adapting existing ones for a new device)
  shouldn't be too difficult for anyone having some experience with
  writing programs in C. Modules for more than 30 devices are already
  part of the package and can be used as a starting point for developing
  drivers for new devices.

* fsc2 is well-documented, an 200+ page documentation in HTML, info,
  PostScript and PDF format is part of the package, covering all aspects
  of fsc2, i.e the graphical interface, the EDL language, device functions
  and the writing of new device modules.

* fsc2 has been extensively tested and is currently used to control seven
  EPR spectrometers and a Single Molecule spectrometer, using a broad range
  of different devices and experimental techniques.

* The complete sources for the program and all device modules are available
  under the GNU Public License, so they can be adapted or extended to fit
  special requirements.

and AT-GPIB/TNT (ISA) cards I wrote and which can be downloaded from
the same URL as fsc2, see above.


Support
-------

While I am prepared to help for free as far as my time allows, you also
can hire me for e.g. writing drivers for ubsupported devices, creating
scripts for experiments, installation support, instructing users etc.
Please send me an email to discuss conditions.


Limitations
-----------

Due to my professional background fsc2 has been written with the different
types of EPR (Electron Paramagnetic Resonance) experiments in mind. On the
other hand, fsc2's basic concepts should make it easy to use it also for
quite a wide range of other types of spectrometers.
