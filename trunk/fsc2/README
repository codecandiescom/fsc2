About fsc2
----------

fsc2 is a program for controlling spectrometers.

Programs for controlling spectrometers are usually home-written and
often restricted to doing a certain set of experiments and a fixed
set of devices. In contrast, fsc2 is much more flexible because, on
the one hand, it interprets a rather simple but powerful scripting
language (EDL, Experiment Description Language) and, on the other hand,
has a strictly modular approach to handling of devices. This allows
setting up a completely new experiment or changing an already existing
one fast and easily without requiring any detailed knowledge of the
internals of fsc2 or how exactly devices are to be controlled by the
computer.

Features
--------

* The EDL language is similar to other medium to high level languages,
  borrowing from e.g. MathLab, Fortran, C and Perl etc. Moreover, it
  comes with a lot of functions for data handling, displaying and saving
  in completely user defined ways. Thus writing a description for a new
  experiment or adapting an already existing EDL script won't be
  difficult for anyone remotely acquainted with one of the above
  mentioned programming languages.

* Device are not hard-coded into fsc2. Instead, devices are dealt with
  by modules that get loaded on demand (a single instruction in an EDL
  script). For each type of device a set of EDL functions exists to
  set up the device and fetch measured data. This allows e.g. to employ
  a different device with similar functionality by usually changing not
  more than a single line in an EDL script.

* fsc2 allows other programs to send it EDL scripts for execution.
  Thus one may write scripts for standard experiments that in turn
  automatically create EDL scripts from user input, for example via
  a graphical user interface. fsc2 even comes with a tool that auto-
  matically generates such scripts from slightly modified EDL programs.
  Once such a script has been created, "normal" users don't have to
  know how to write or change EDL programs, thus retaining all the
  convenience of the traditional type of programs but without
  sacrificing its flexibility.

* fsc2 has a built-in simple web server (only running on user demand)
  that allows the user to remotely monitor the state of an experiment.

* Currently fsc2 controls devices that are either connected via the
  serial ports or the GPIB bus.

* Writing new device modules (or adapting existing ones for a new device)
  shouldn't be too difficult for anyone having some experience with
  writing programs in C. About 30 modules for quite a range of devices
  are already part of the package and can be used as a starting point
  for developing drivers for new devices.

* fsc2 is well-documented, an 180 page documentation in HTML, info,
  PostScript and PDF format, covering all aspects of fsc2, i.e the
  graphical interface, the EDL language, device functions and writing of
  new device modules, is part of the package.

* fsc2 has been extensively tested and is currently used to control seven
  EPR spectrometers, using a broad range of different devices and   
  experimental techniques.

* The complete sources for the program and all device modules are available
  under the GNU Public License, so they can be adapted or extended to fit
  all special requirements.

fsc2 works with three different GPIB driver/library combinations, the
Linux Lab Project driver (http://www.llp.fu-berlin.de), the National
Instruments driver (http://www.natinst.com) and a driver for NI PCII
and AT-GPIB/TNT (ISA) cards I wrote and which can be downloaded from
the same URL as fsc2, see above.


Limitations
-----------

Due to my professional background fsc2 has been written with the different
types of EPR (Electron Paramagnetic Resonance) experiments in mind. On the
other hand, fsc2's basic concepts should make it easy to use it also for a
wide range of other types of spectrometers.
