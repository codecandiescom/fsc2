/* The device can transfer numerical data either in ASCII or binary
   format. The advantage of ASCII is that it's human readable which
   can help a lot during debugging, but has the disadvantage that
   it requires more data to be transfered and reduces the number of
   points that can be used in sweeps by more than a factor of 3.
   Binary data are more difficult to read but allow faster transfers
   and more points in sweeps. If the macro 'BINARAY_TRANSFER' is
   defined the module is compiled for binary transfers, if it's not
   defined ASCII transfer is used. */

/* If you compile the module for a model that has only a single channel

   specify it in the arguments of the functions, define (uncomment) the
