a) scan the whole field region
     1) on overflow reduce sensitivity and and start again (plus set flag)
b) get highest and lowest point
c) if flag not set go to highest of abs() of highest and lowest point
     1) increment sensitivity until overload is reached
     2) reduce sensitivity again
     3) if new sensitivity is different from initial one rescan
d) (after first scan) set center field to average of field of highest and
   lowest point
